# Zalvis Promo Codes and Latest Zalvis Managed WordPress Hosting Deals for 2026

Looking for a WordPress hosting solution that actually delivers on speed and security? Zalvis has been making waves in the hosting world, and for good reason. They're one of the first companies to build managed WordPress hosting on Kubernetes infrastructure, which basically means your site gets to live in its own little protective bubble with dedicated resources. No more sharing space with hundreds of other websites that might slow you down.

What makes them interesting is their approach to pricing. While competitors charge $25-30/month for hosting a single site, Zalvis lets you host 5 websites for the same price. That's the kind of math that makes sense for anyone managing multiple projects or client sites.

## Zalvis Introduction

Zalvis launched back in 2017 as an independent, bootstrapped company. Unlike many hosting providers that have been acquired by larger corporations, they've stayed independent, which gives them the flexibility to innovate without answering to venture capital investors.

Their platform runs on custom-built Zalvis Cloud powered by Docker containerization technology. Each website operates in its own isolated environment, which means if one site gets hit with a traffic surge, it doesn't affect your other sites. The infrastructure automatically scales resources when needed, so you're not stuck with rigid limits that might crash your site during that viral moment you've been working toward.

The technical stack includes LiteSpeed web servers, NVMe SSD storage, and a global CDN that comes standard with all plans. They've also developed their own caching technology called "Zalvis Cache" that stores frequently accessed data in RAM for faster retrieval. For WordPress specifically, they offer SmartUpdates that handle core WordPress updates automatically, unlimited staging environments for testing changes, and developer tools like SSH access, Git integration, and WP-CLI.

Security features include 24/7 malware scanning, a web application firewall, DDoS protection, free SSL certificates, and daily automated backups stored for 30 days. Their Viking Security system monitors sites around the clock and isolates suspicious files immediately.

The support team operates 24/7/365 with live chat and ticket systems. According to reviews on Trustpilot and other platforms, they consistently earn ratings above 4.4 out of 5, with users particularly praising the competence and patience of support staff.
